        <p>
          Some might say React hooks are good due to less coding.
          Accordind to Douglas Crockford`s report 2014 it`s not the
          point. So it can`t be used as a profit and with this in mind I
          will skip telling that using hooks leads to less keypressing.
        </p>

          My report is to show common useCases when coding React.
          So stay tuned...
